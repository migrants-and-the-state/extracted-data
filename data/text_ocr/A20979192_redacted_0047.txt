Screened by NARA, 4/27/2023 THE STATE OF UTAH DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION SALT LAKE CITY May 26, 1928 Brumo Marez Nebo School District Dear Pupil: I have just had the pleasure of signing your certificate of membership in the Utah State Pupils' Reading Circle. Your district superintendent of schools will place his name on the certificate and then forward it to you. This reading project is a means of encouraging boys and girls to become acquainted with the remarkably choice literature which is now available to young people. You have taken advantage of this opportunity and thereby become a member of a unique group of young people throughout the State possessing a common literary culture. I congratulate you on your achieve- ment, and trust you will continue to use every available leisure moment in school and at home in reading the best of books. It gives me unusual pleasure to send you this tangible evidence of your industry and application. Without doubt you are aware that when you have received four such certificates and done the required reading for the fifth year you will receive a life membership in the Circle, Life membership in the Circle will be an honor worthy of the best efforts of any boy or girl in the State. Very truly yours, State Superintendent of Public Instruction. CNJ*RM
