Screened by NARA, 7/18/2023 -2- The total amount invested which we can document at this time is thus $7,784.20. In addition to this, numerous other pieces of equipment were purchased for which we have been unable to obtain a receipt as yet. In addition to the purchases, a sum of money was required as working capital to carry the busi- ness through its first few weeks of operation. This working capital totalled at least $2,000.00. We hope that this will satisfy your requirements and that you will process the case as soon as possible. Thank you for your cooperation. Very truly yours, Rullen BERNARD COOPER Attorney at Law BC/sa Enclosures P.S. We will attempt to obtain receipts for remainder of initial investment. These should Ryceed $ 10,000 B.C.
