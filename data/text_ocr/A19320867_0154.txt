It is concluded that you neither have a residence in the United States which you have no intention of abandoning nor can your absence be construed to be a temporary visit. Your application is therefore denied. There is no provision for an appeal from this denial. Your Reentry Permit #1205586 which is valid for application for admission to the United States until January 6, 1982 is herewith returned. Sincerely, Donald A.- Young Officer-in-Charge INS:JG:pw
