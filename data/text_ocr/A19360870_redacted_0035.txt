Screened by NARA, 7/11/2023 God forbid, if any serious situation arises, Iwant her to have some document which should enable her to be with us without any loss of time. Need I mention her handicaps On top of her ill health 1. she is widow, thus completly supported by melhirere ever she live, 2.She is old, in her sixties, 3. She does not know english. To be very frank and truthful, I do not have the mind and heart to tell an unhealthy parent to leave my home and I am sure no body in his right mind would do it. Every body's parents paid the price to bring their children up and when they need us most, we should not turn our back. And then who knows how long they are go- ing to live- life is too short Under the light of the above circumstances. I would requuest you to look at the case again and guide me the way. In the meantime please extend her normal stay with me. Thank you, yours very truly, theith Chet Mehta for Savitri Devi Mehta.
