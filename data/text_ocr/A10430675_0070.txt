Last June he advanced another step in his progress by earning the Master's degree in Electrical Engineering. His work and his examination were uniformly satisfactory. He is now embarking on a program leading toward the Ph. D. degree. We have confidence in Mr. Liu and want to give him every opportunity to advance toward his educational objec- tive. Very truly yours, alamy Henry E.
