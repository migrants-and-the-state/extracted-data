Y. MAIL UNIT COUNTY OF NEW YORK ) Date10-29-56 Accepted by gen MAR DOO, being duly sworn, deposes and says: My address is care of Soon Hing Farm, Box 54, Green Lawn, Long Island, New York. I am a native and citizen of China and have never acquired the citizenship of any other country. I entered the United States as a seaman on December 23, 1955 and by reason of the fact that I remained longer than authorized, I was made the subject of deportation proceedings. Although I was gtanted voluntary departure, the outstanding order to such effect provided that such departure from the United States be effected on or before November 3, 1956. Since I am not in a position to depart from the United States and since the Immigration and Naturalization Service has been advised accordingly, I assume that an order of deportation is now outstanding against me. This application is made for a stay of deporta- tion pursuant to the provisions of Section 243h of the Immigration and Nationality Act on the ground that if I were deported to China at this time, I would be subjected to physical persecution by rea- son of the fact that I am opposed to Communism. Sworn to before me this 22 day of October, 1956. #7 MAR DOO (In Chinese) Haven Brun Mar Doo Notary Public MAR DOO (In English) HASKELL R.
