UCKFIELD REGISTRATION DISTRICT R. L. NYE, Superintendent Registrar Croham Road, Crowborough, Sussex. Telephone No.: 3292/3/4 30th January 1968 To whom it mayconcern: Roy Alford Le Voi and Beryl Irma Nightingale On the 5th April 1946 a marriage between the above parties was performed at this office and the entry of such marriage is contained in register number 11A for the Uckfield Registration District entry number 184 and the original register is still held in our custody. The two people concerned were previously to the marriage divorced from their respective partners in India and before such marriage could take place it is the custom and practice for all foreign divorce decrees to be submitted to the Registrar General's Office at Somerset House, London to confirm that they conform with the legal requirements of this country before any wedding is allowed to proceed. In view of the facts stated above we have no doubt that the matter was satisfactorily dealt with according to the legal requirements of this country and that such Indian divorces were considered valid. Ronald L. Nye the then Deputy Superintendent Registrar is still to this day the Superintendent Registrar for this area. Yours faithfully, (Charles Henry Santer) Deputy Superintendent Registrar
