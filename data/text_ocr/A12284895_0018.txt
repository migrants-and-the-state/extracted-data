LAW OFFICES MARVIN M. NEUMAN PHILADELPHIA OFFICE NEW YORK OFFICE 602 FINANCE BUILDING SECOND FLOOR 1428 SOUTH PENN SQUARE 130 W. 58TH STREET LOCUST 3-6358 COLUMBUS 5-7866 April 21, 1961 1991 APP Immigration and Naturalization Service 150 Tremont Street Boston, Mass. Your File Unknown Visa Petition of Szeto Getman Gentlemen: Enclosed is my entry of appearance on behalf of the subject above named, together with Form I-130, photos of the petitioner and beneficiary, and my check in the amount of $10.00, filing fee. Please note that the subject's certificate of naturalization No. 8-205-147, is not being submitted with the application inasmuch as he was admitted to citizenship on March 11, 1961, in the United States District Court at Boston. I believe that his original petition to file for naturalization is contained in your files. Your attention is called to the fact that the same petitioner previously filed a visa petition for the same wife at your offices. However, said petition had been filed by him in his paper name of Yee Nee Yon. It would be appreciated if the evidence offered in the former petition were made available in the instant matter. Yours very truly, human Marvin M. Neuman
