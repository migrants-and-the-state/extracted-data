Unless you can furnish us with the dates or at least the year of the birth or death we will not be able to be of any assitance to you. Your letter did not state exactly what records you want, or on whom you want them. We do have the death certificate of your step-father registered in 1919. There are not births registered in this year, either in the name of "Tello" or "Palos". For a record of your attendance in the Salt Lake City Schools, you will have to contact the Board of Education, 440 East 1st South, where those records are kept. Be sure when writing to them, that you give them as much detailed information as possible to assist them in locating the record. If we can be of further assistance to you in this matter, please do not hesitate to write us again. truly, Lillian Larson, Director Vital Statistics Division
