Screened by NARA, 8/25/2023 INFORMATION REGARDING TUBERCULOSIS IN ALIEN APPLICANTS PAGE 2 A recent chest x-ray of the alien taken in his or her country, if submitted to the physicians at the Barlow Sanatorium and Hospital in advance, will be most helpful in predicting how long the observation period might be and in determining the possibility of treatment. In the past, less than one out of twenty-five applicants for evaluation have been found to have active disease requiring hospitalization; nevertheless, the sponsor must realize that the possibility of treatment being needed exists before making final arrangements. Any information from the applicant's physician in his or her previous country of residence will be helpful in making the preliminary decision.
