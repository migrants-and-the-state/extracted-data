Albans, VT 05479 Dear Officer, I am writing to you with regard to my father's petition for alien relative. You asked me to provide marriage certificate which I cannot provide for the following reasons: a. there is a civil war and chaos in Somalia with no government or any other authority. Government properties were either looted or destroyed. b. may family's home in Somalia was looted like many other homes in Somalia losing everything including documents. C. my father fled Somalia and is presently in Kenya waiting to join my mother who is here in the U.S. d. because of reasons stated above, it is not possible to obtain marriage certificate or any other document presently in Somalia. I am providing two affidavits from people who know my family and have a knowledge of their marriage. Please speed up my father's petition process, he is stranded in Kenya and he is also very sick. I appreciate very much for your help. ounry at Fortax Commonwealth of Virginic FOIA (b)(6) subscribed and sworn to before me This 9th day of OCTOBER 10 92 by HASSAN ALI WARSAUR retary Public Stre My w Commission Expires 1130 is 1995
