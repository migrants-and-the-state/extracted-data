Major District Director United States Department of Justice Immigration and Naturalization Service 819 U.S. Courthouse Kansas City, Missouri 64106 Dear Mr. Major: I have reviewed the blood groups of Lawrence Tchi-Kien Leang FOIA (b)(6) 4.4 t the petitioner, and his alleged family Yue-Tsi Leang (A20 258 691), alleged father: Pei-King Leang (A20_258 690) ; alleged mother; and 'TC 6-28 FOIA (b)(6) , alleged brother. A possible relationship may exist. The results of the four proposed family members are as follows: The blood groups of the petitioner and his parents are Group B. The alleged brother FOIA (b) (6) which is a possible offspring assuming that both parents are FOIA (b)(6) . The Rh factors of the family are attached p2 as well as a compatible choice of genotypes CDe/cde (R'r) for the alleged father: CDE/Cde (R2') for the alleged mother; FOIA (b)(6) ; CDe/Cde (R'r') for the petitioner Lawrence. Note that for the mother, Dr. Lindley reported the probable genotype as R2 R1 assuming the homozygosity of D. This assumption would not be FOIA (b)(6) For the petitioner, Lawrence, Dr. Lindley proposed as a probable genotype R1R1, but R'r' is essential for compatibility to be possible between the parents and both alleged sons. If I can be of further assistance, please let me know. Sincerely yours, mayminte CandlewBulland Marguerite Candler Ballard, M.D. Medical Director Clinical Chemistry and Hematology Training Unit Laboratory Training Section
