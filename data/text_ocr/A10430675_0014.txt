Spokane, Washington August 26, 1958 A10 430 675 Mr. Maoling Liu 806 Linden St., Apt. A Pullman, Washington Dear Sir: This is in reply to your letter of August 18, 1958 addressed to the St. Paul office of this Service. It is noted that you state you came to the state of Washington during the week beginning August 10, 1958. Since the naturalization law requires that to be eligible to file a petition for naturaliza- tion the applicant must have resided in the state in which the petition is filed for the period of at least 6 months immediately preceding the date on which the petition is filed, it appears that you will not be eligible to file a petition until about the middle of February, 1959. It is suggested that if you are still residing at Pullman in January, 1959 you may request this office to furnish you the appropriate application form and instructions relative to the manner in which you should proceed. Pages 11 to 14 of the enclosed pamphlet N-18 contain in- formation regarding general naturalization requirements of spouses of citizens of the United States. Very truly yours, C. F. Tomlin Naturalization Examiner CFT/oj
