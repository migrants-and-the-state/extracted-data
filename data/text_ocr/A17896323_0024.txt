Box 61630 Houston, Texas 77061 April 27, 1967 Clerk Fannin County District Court Bonham, Texas Re: Josef Tiras Dear Sir: Reference is made to recent correspondence in which you indicate that no record was found relating to Subject. Our San Antonio office has old index books which indicate that one Josef Tiras filed a Declaration of Intention on October 10, 1888 and a petition for natu- ralization on February 4, 1892, both in the District Court of Fannin County. There is also in the possession of Subject's son a Naturalization Certificate showing that Josef Tiras was naturalized in that court on March 5, 1892. With this information now available, will you make a further search of your records and complete the attached form N-25. If you still find no record pertain- ing to this case, please advise us accordingly. A self- addressed envelope is attached for your convenience. Thank you for your assistance in this matter. Yours very truly, Billy K. Chapman General Attorney (Nationality) Incls: Form N-25
