Screened by NARA, 6/7/2023 United States Department of State Washington. D.C. 20520 September 15, 1987 NAME: FONSECA, Terencio A # : 28 417 099 COUNTRY of BIRTH or NATIONAL of NICARAGUA Mr. James W. Pomeroy, District Director Immigration and Naturalization Service Federal Building 970 Broad Street, Room 308 Newark, New Jersey 07102 Dear Mr. Pomeroy: This is in response to your letter asking for an advisory opinion on the above applicant's request for asylum in the United States. In our view, the allegations made in the application do not constitute a valid claim of persecution on the basis of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. It follows that the application fails to demonstrate that the applicant has a well-founded fear of persecution upon return to Nicaragua within the meaning of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended. Our opinion is based on information about country conditions and other relevant factors available to the Department of State through its conduct of foreign affairs, together with the information specific to the applicant provided in the application. We do not have independent information about this applicant. The strength of the application may be affected by your interview or hearing, or additional information subsequently presented by the applicant. Should you believe that any such additional information warrants further consideration, we will be happy to review the file again. I trust that this advisory opinion will be helpful in reaching a decision in this case. Sincerely, Edward Dilb Edward H. Wilkinson, Director Office of Asylum Affairs 186 Bureau of Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs
