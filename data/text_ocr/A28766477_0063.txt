Screened by NARA, 6/1/2023 The Sandinistas have three AT-33A jets, and in 1984 top FSLN leaders repeatedly proclaimed their desire to acquire additional jet fighters. Nicaraguan pilots and mechanics reportedly have been undergoing training in Cuba and the Soviet bloc since the early 1980s. In 1982, with Cuban and Soviet assistance, the Sandinistas began constructing the Punta Huete airfield in an isolated area MI-24/HIND D EARTHEN northeast of Managua. The principal runway at Punta HELICOPTER REVETMENT Huete is 10,000 feet in length, making it the longest military runway in Central America. When completed, it will be able to accommodate any aircraft in the Soviet- bloc inventory. Sixteen revetments of the size and design appropriate for jet fighters already have been con- structed. In addition to Punta Huete, the Sandinistas have been upgrading their principal airbase at Sandino Airport in Managua as well as other airfields at Montelimar, Puerto Cabezas, Esteli, La Rosita, and Bluefields. The initial shipments of Mi-24s arrived at Sandino Airport in November 1984. The helicopters are shipped in crates and assembled at the airport, probably with the assistance of Soviet or Cuban techni- cians.
