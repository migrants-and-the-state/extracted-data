A possible relationship may exist. The results of the four proposed family members are au Lollows: The blood groups of the petitioner and his parents are Group B. The alleged brother FOIA (b) (6) which is a possible offspring assuming that both parents are FOIA (b)(6) . The Rh factors of the family are attached p2 as well as a compatible choice of genotypes CDe/cde (R'r) for the alleged father: CDE/Cde (R2'') for the alleged mother; FOIA (b)(6) ; CDe/Cde (R'r') for the petitioner Lawrence. Note that for the mother, Dr. Lindley reported the probable genotype as R2 R1 assuming the homozygosity of D. This assumption would not be FOIA (b)(6) For the petitioner, Lawrence, Dr. Lindley proposed as a probable genotype R1R1, but R'r' is essential for compatibility to be possible between the parents and both alleged sons.
