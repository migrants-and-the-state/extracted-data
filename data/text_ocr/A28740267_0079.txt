Screened by NARA, 7/28/2023 August 2, 1988 U. S. Department of Justice Immigration and Naturalization Service 630 Samsome St San Francisco, Ca. 94111 File : A28 740 267 (E-24) Gentlemen: I would like to testify on behalf of my grandfather MR. MARCELINO SOLIS-ROMERO, a Nicaraguan Citizen, 83 years of age who may be in jeopardy of persecution by the Sandinista Government due to the following facts: a) I was a Director of Jail Systems for the Boaco Municipality (Department). b) I am a deserter of the Sandinista Army, action that I took when I left the country for the U.S. c) Many of my cousins were members of the Sandisnita Army and as well as myself they are also deserters and if we return to Nicaragua there is no doubt we face jail even a potential retaliation against any member of our family. The reason I am bringing these facts into your consideration for my grandfather application for political asylum it is because I know that if return to Nicaragua, the Sandinista Government may force him he thru torture or other methods to tell them where his relatives are. I would like to ask you for mercy and consideration to his request, because he can not got back to Nicaragua. It will be a crime :and injustice not to allow him to stay in the U.S.- - He has never received a penny from the welfare or any other social service department. During his stay in the U.S. he has lived with his daughter, who is a legal resident alien, in process to become a U. S. citizen. Under penalty of perjury, I declare that the above statement is nothing the true FOIA (b)(6)
