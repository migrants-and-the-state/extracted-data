Screened by NARA, 9/18/2023 I have been married to one man. I ma ied Ben Dong WONG on Dec. 17, 1930 at Ping Lok Vil,, HSD., China. A short time after we were married my husband went to the United States as the son of a man from a nearby village. This man had already taken my husband's brother to the United States before we were married. My husband took the name Guck on WONG when he went to the United States. He was told that he would claim he had never been married so that would agree with the Immigration story of his family. My husband went to the United States in 1933 and then he returned to China the next year and stayed in the village until 1936. When he left he told me he would report that he had mar ied me on this trip and also that we had two sons. My husband visited us again in 1948 and 1949. I accompanied my husband when he returned to the United States in 1949. My husband had petit oned for me as a citizen of the United States before going to China in 1948. When I applied for a visa at Canton City, China I told the American officials my husband was a citizen of the United States and that his name was Guck On WONG. I knew he was a citizen of China. I still live with my husband. We have three children who are Don Lem WONG a son born at Ping Lok Vil., TSD., China on 12/6/34. He came to the U. S. as my husb nd's U. s. ctizen son in 1950. He now lives at 2625 Wilshire Blvd., Sant a Monica. California where he has a laundrv. We have two sons who were FOIA (b)(6) FOIA (b)(6) My husband had reported an imigration son when he returned to the United States in 1936 so on my application for a visa I claimed we had a son named Don Chee WONG born on 2/13/36. We never had such a son and we did not try to bring anyone to the United States who was not our son. I have never been arrested.
