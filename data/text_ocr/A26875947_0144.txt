Screened by NARA, 8/11/2023 - 3 - Section 245(a) of the Act provides that only an alien who is eligible to receive an immigrant visa and is admissible to the United States for permanent residence may have his/her status adjusted to that of a permanent resident. Since we have held you to be inadmissible (excludable) from the United States pursuant to Sections 212 (a) (15), public charge, and (19), visa fraud, you are ineligible for adjustment of status to permanent resident and your application is hereby denied.
