312 E. Cedar Ave. # you T. Burbank, Ca. 91.502 27 1977 September 25, 1977 To District Director Immigration and Naturalization Service Los Angeles, California Dear Sir: Enclosed is the copy of "Notice of Approval of Relative Immigrant Visa Petition" ( Form I-171 ). . Please note that we would like to re-activate the files ( A 21 557 566 and A 21 557 567 ) to obtain the Permanent Residentship status for my parents who are now in the United States on the Visitor Visa. Last year they had to leave the United States due to un avoidable circumstances of the family health. I shall greatly appreciate your sending me the application form ( Form I-485 ) as early as possible so that we may continue with their immigration process. Thank you very much. Sincerely yours, Panimal M. Patel Parimal M. Patel
