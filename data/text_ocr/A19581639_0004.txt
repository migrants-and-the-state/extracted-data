Mrs. Dhankunvar Mohanlal Gatha, a one-time permanent resident, returned to the United States on a visitor's visa. Upon her application for an extension, she was advised to request a permanent stay. Mrs. Gatha is eighty-four years old and suffer- ing from ill-health. As she has no family living in India to care for her, her family is most concerned over how she will continue to live if forced to return to India. I would be most appreciative of your favorable consideration of Mrs. Gatha's request for a permanent stay. I am looking forward to your earliest possible response. Very truly yours, Robert 2. matsui Robert T.
