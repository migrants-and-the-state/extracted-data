Screened by NARA, 7/13/2023 FILE: A23 606 639 IN RE: Elida Bolanos IN BEHALF OF APPLICANT: Pro Se APPLICATION: REQUEST FOR ASYLUM IN THE UNITED STATES DISCUSSION: on October 16, 1979 the above named alien, a national of Nicaragua applied for asylum in the United States. Section 208 (a) of the Immigration and Naturalization Act provided that an alien may be granted asylum if it is determined that he or she is a refugee within the meaning of section 101 (a) (42) of the Act, which states: "The term refugee means (A) any person who is outside any country of such person's nationality or, in the case of a person having no nationality, is outside any country in which such person last habitually resided, and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion " It has been held that in asylum proceedings the applicant bears the burden of proving that a fear of persecution is well-founded. TO meet this burden the applicant must demonstrate actual persecution or show good reason why persecution is feared. (Kashani V. USINS 547 F. 2d, 376, 7th Cir. 1977). The applicant may support claims by submitting evidentiary material and/or testimony describing previous actions taken by authorities against the applicant or others in similar circumstances. (Fleurinor V. INS, 585 F. 2d 129, 5th Cir. 1978). However, generalized statements or conjec- tures describing fears are insufficient to establish that these fears are well-founded. (Kashani V. USINS, supra). The applicant was interviewed under oath on March 12, 1984. The testimony and relating material must be considered in the light of knowledge as to conditions in the applicant's home country, and the treatment given by authorities there to persons of differing backgrounds and beliefs. An advisory opinion was requested from the Bureau of Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs, Department of State. The information received is advisory only and does not relieve the applicant of the burden to demonstrate that a fear of persecution is well-founded.
