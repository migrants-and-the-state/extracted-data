Informa- tion solicited which indicates a violation or potential violation of law, whether civil, criminal, or regulatory in nature, may be referred, as a routine use, to the appropriate agency, whether federal, state, local or foreign, charged with the responsibility of investigating, enforcing or prosecuting such violations. Failure to provide all or any of the requested information may result in an unfavor- able recommendation as to a petitioner's eligibility for naturalization and denial by the court of a petition for naturalization.
