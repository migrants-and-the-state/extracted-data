This would certainly help the family and relieve you. So far we still haven't find the right one to buy yet. Jick Fai brothers were looking for a British-made or German-made because they will be more durable and easy to change parts. American-made or Japan-made cars look gorgeous but is is very difficult to change parts. We found some cars quite good, but the price was agreeable. We intend to buy s used one, 80 or 60 percent new one, because it would be easier to find. But a used car probably needs to be repaired from time to time, which will present a problem, because the purpose of buying a car is to use it to make a living. In your letter you stated that you sent $200.00 for Mom's use, but I as afraid to use it DCN before we buy 8 car. After we bought the car, I will go to uncle Chiu Suey's place to cash it. After we bought the car, we have to buy auto insurance on mouthly basis, because everybody is doing the same. will write to you again later when we found a car to buy.
