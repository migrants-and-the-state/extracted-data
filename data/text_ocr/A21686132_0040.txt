On December 9, 2002, I sent an alien registration number as requested by your office. Since then, I have not received a response from your office in regards to my status and it has been almost six years since my first attempt. I am already 96 years old and eagerly awaiting to become a U.S. citizen. I came to this country in 1978 and all of my children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren are U.S. citizens. I too would like to be a U.S. citizen before it is too late. If your office could send any type of response about the status of my application, I would greatly appreciate it. If there are any problems, please let me know as soon as possible. Thank you for your time od with CC: Respected Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, I dearly request your good office to help me out to become a U.S.A.
