Due to the volume of fingerprints contained in the fingerprint files of the FBI, and the use of super break-ups and extensions in conjunction with the Henry Classification System, it is necessary to obtain exact ridge counts and tracings of all ten fingers in order to search our files properly. In the event of serious injury to a finger precluding the taking of prints of the finger at this time, it is suggested that printing be done at a later date when a complete set of prints may be secured. It is suggested that reprints be obtained and forwarded to the FBI for appropriate attention. When submitting the reprints it is not necessary to return the original fingerprint card, as only one copy of each set of fingerprints is necessary for retention in this Bureau's files. For your information, a check by name only has been made on the enclosed prints with negative results. Thank you for your cooperation in this matter.
