Screened by NARA, 8/11/2023 Page 2 Ms. Petit is currently on a 240 day waiting period which does not cover her for general medical services. However, there are immediate bene- fits for major illnesses as outlined on page 13 of the Blue Cross Sub- scriber's certificate. Ms. Petit also has a three year health statement restriction, per our guidelines, on a pre-existing condi- tion. Since health statement restrictions are strictly confidential, only Ms. Petit can apprise you regarding the supplemental agreement she signed. The subscriber certificate thoroughly details the terms of her con- tract. If you have need of any further clarifications, please do not hesitate to contact me.
