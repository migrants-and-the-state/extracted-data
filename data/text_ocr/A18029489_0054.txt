I was asked to submit my B.E. degree. I have already submitted the Certificate of "Assistant Engineer" of The Thomason Civil Engineering College Roorkee, which is on your file. This certificate was issued by the college before it was changed to Roorkee University and is the approved degree equivalent by the state and central government. In proof, I enclose my service certificate of the positions held by me in Fertilizer Cor Of India which is a Central Government of India undertaking. The advertisements for these positions called for engineering degree and the certificate of "Assistant Engineer" of Thomason Civil Engineering College was considered as degree equivalent, and I was appointed to these positions.
