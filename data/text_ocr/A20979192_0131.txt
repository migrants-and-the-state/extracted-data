Screened by NARA, 4/27/2023 January 12, 1982 10 03 AM '82 LOS DISTRICT OFFICE U.S. Department of Justice Immigration and Naturalization Service North Los Angeles Street Los Angeles, CA 90012 Re: A20 979 192 PALOS BRUNO ORNELAS To Whom It May Concern: In 1977 I visited your department with documents in application for Legal Residence. These documents were to serve as proof that I had been in the U.S. for a number of years. At that time, these documents were left in your office and I was told that they would be returned to me shortly. To date, I have not received these papers and there are some certificates that I am trying to retrieve since they are important to me. One in particular, an old stock certificate left with you is the primary one I am trying to retrieve. This letter serves as a request to have this certificate returned to me as soon as possible. Thank you for your prompt attention to this request. Sincerely, Pabs Burno Ourseler Palos Bruno Ornelas A20 979 192 290 Princeton Avenue Claremont, CA 91711 (714) 624-6948
