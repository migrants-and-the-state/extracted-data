Screened by NARA, 7/31/2023 -2- 7. We were certain that my mother would be granted an immigrant visa within six months. However, since we have not received any decision on the application from Calgary over the past one and a half years, combined with the fact that we are no longer close to Calgary, Canada, we requested the U.S. Consulate General in Calgary to forward her file to you. 8. The most recent affidavit of support for my mother, executed by me and my brother, was sent to Calgary in May of 1976. The Supplement to Form Letter DSL-869 was also filed. 9. Copies of the original documents recently submitted to the U.S. Consulate General in Calgary are enclosed for your reference. 10. Sending my mother back and forth to India is not only an expensive affir, but also psychologically upsetting to her. Anything you can do to expedite the granting of an immigrant visa to my mother will be greatly appreciated. If you need any additional information, please call me collect at +(617) 653-6278 (home) or (617) 734-6700 x149 (office). Sincerely yours, symain Shabir Z. Masih, Ph.D. SZM/ac
