UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY MINNEAPOLIS 14 6-699-884 DEPARTMENT OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING February 15, 1951 Mr. Rex Griffin Immigration and Naturelization Service 1014 New Post Office Building St. Paul 1, Minnesota My dear Mr. Griffin: The last time I was at your office I answered a questionnaire in which I was asked to give my addresses during the last five years. I am afraid that I made a mistake on one of them. From February to May of 1947 I lived at 27 - 27th Ave. S. E., , Minneapolis, not 27 Oak Street S. E. 27 - 27th Ave. S. E. is at the terminal of the Oak-Harriet Street car line which accounts for the error. I am sorry to have made the mistake and I hope this will set the record straight. Sincerely yours, Trianting Maoling Liu Lin ML: jlw SECURITY INVENTION IMM. RECEIVED ST. NAT 16 1951 EDITION 1851 FOUNDED IN THE FAITH THAT MEN ARE ENNOBLED BY UNDERSTANDING .
