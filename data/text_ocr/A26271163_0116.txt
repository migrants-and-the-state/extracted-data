If copies of the files can be sent to MTL instead of the file that would be preferred, otherwise the file should be attempted to be returned to the NRC as soon as possible. Thank you, Joshua Dorman Program Assistant (Contract Performance) Department of Homeland Security USCIS/NRC, Lee's Summit, MO FOIA (b)(6) From: Robertson, Paula M Sent: Friday, August 02, 2013 11:12 AM To: NRC, Field-Processes Subject: RE: Axx XXX 163 Good morning Joshua, Thank you so much for looking into this. The file is needed for Naturalization application processing at the MTL field office, so I can put a memo with the file to return it to you as requested, but can't guarantee they would do it. If they do approve the application, they will more than likely retire the file anyway. Please advise further. Thanks. 1
