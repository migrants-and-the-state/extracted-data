Screened by NARA, 9/21/2023 2761 Department of Employment April 21, .1969 State of California Page 2. The Immigration Officer has advised US that if we can get prompt clearance from the California Department of Employment it is likely that Mrs. Mao will be cleared by their agency to remain in our employ. We are therefore hopeful that this application can be processed expeditiously by you, since the immigration quota is still open. Your help will be most appreciated. Incidentally, in late 1959 the California Department of Employment approved our application for the employment of Mr. and Mrs. C. T. Lu, from Hongkong. The Lus remained with US for seven years and left in June 1967 only because they were offered a substantial increase in salary by a Beverly Hills family. Sincerely yours, Philip S. Fogg PSF/Ic 12;
