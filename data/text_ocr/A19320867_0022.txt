RESEARCH CEN ER ON THE PSYCHOBIOLOU OF ETHNICITY HARBOR-UCLA RESEARCH AND EDUCATION INSTITUTE DEPARTMENT OF PSYCHIATRY May 1, 1997 RE: Wu, Chi-Su SSN: 388-70-9424 Date of Birth: February 8, 1914 Address: 7024 Hedgewood Dr., Rancho Palos Verdes CA 90274 TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN: Mrs.Chi-Su Wu has been evaluated at this office for her memory problems. Mrs. Wu showed definitive signs of difficulties in recent memories which could seriously interfere with her ability to acquire and retain new information. The condition has been slowly progressive and is deemed permanent in nature. In my opinion, she should be exempted from the language and citizenship examination as the acquiring of such new information would be exceedingly difficult for her and may present undue stress with deleterious consequence. Sincerely, Keh-Ming Lin, M.D., M.P.H.
