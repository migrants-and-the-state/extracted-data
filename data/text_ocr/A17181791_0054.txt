FOGG CHAIRMAN OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE April 21, 1969 Department of Employment State of California Re: Betty Pei-ing Mao Gentlemen: Attached are the ES-575 A & B forms for our employment of Betty Pei-ing Mao, Chinese alien. Due to certain unusual circumstances involved, I am adding the following data. Mrs. Mao was cleared for immigration to the United States late 1967 by the Far Eastern Employment Agency of Los Angeles, as agent, to enter the employment of a Mr. Harriman in Newport Beach, California. Prior to her arrival, the Harrimans had hired someone else and the Agency, without further documentation, assigned her to a Dr. Monaco in Newport Beach. Mrs. Mao arrived in Los Angeles on January 17, 1968 and went to work for the Monacos. For a variety of reasons she was soon very unhappy with her employers and in June 1968, thru a Chinese friend, applied for employment with US. We checked with the Monacos and hired her as cook and house maid on June 16, 1968. Mrs. Mao is a very remarkable Chinese lady from Taiwan, in her early fifties, a fine cook, emotionally stable, and a great asset to US. Last week, the U. S. Immigration Service in Los Angeles called US for a hearing and stated that Mrs. Mao was now illegally in the United States due to the fact that she did not go to work for the original applicant, Mr. Harriman. 1953
