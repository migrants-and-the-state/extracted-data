Dear Mr. Palos: We have checked the district records for the years from 1923 through 1926 and have not been able to find a record of your school attendance in this district. This is an elementary district and if you were in high school at the time you lived in Artesia you would have attended the Excelsior High School. If this is true, I would suggest that you write them--P. O. Box 218, Norwalk, California. Sorry we have been unable to help you. Darcy's Shagge Darcy A. Skaggs District Superintendent DAS:bma
