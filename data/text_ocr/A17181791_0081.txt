Screened by NARA, 9/21/2023 660038 april 1964 To Whom it May Concern: Pei Ing Mao, whom we know as "Betty". has worked in this house for the last sixteen months. She has done general housework. laundering and helped prepare meals. She sews nicely, and besides the household mending , can give a hand with the draperies, shi-covers. etc. and do the hand- seuring and finishing of dresses. Betty works hard, has a nice disposition and is loyal to her employer. She is completely honest, had to access valuables and money. but we have never lost anything. neither do the kitchen supplies evaporate or diminish while she is looking after them. She leaves this employ because of our departure from Tawan and we are sorry to lose her. m. Danielsen House 23 Shihmen Dam Campsite
