Screened by NARA, 8/11/2023 The visa petition filed on your behalf to accord you classi- fication as an immediate relative or spouse of an lawful permanent resident alien has been withdrawn. In the absence of any indi- cation that you are entitled to any other immigrant classification you must, pursuant to Section 203(d) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, be presumed to be classifiable as a nonpreference immigrant. A nonpreference immigrant, who will be employed in the United States, is subject to the provisions of Section 212(a)(14) of that Act, as amended. That Section requires that such an immigrant obtain a certification from the Department of Labor that a shortage exists of qualified workers who are available to perform the work in which he would be engaged, and that his employment would not adversely affect the wages and working con- ditions of persons similarly employed in this country. It appears that you meet the aforementioned labor certification requirement. (Section 212.8, Title 8, CFR). Since you have failed to submit the labor certification and are subject to the requirement, you are ineligible under Section 245. 1 (e), Title 8 CFR, for adjustment of status as a nonpreference immigrant. In addition, by failing to comply with the labor certification requirement, you have not acquired a priority date for allocation of a nonpreference visa number. Accordingly, you have not established that an immigrant visa is immediately available as required by Section 245 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended. ATTACHMENT TO I-291
