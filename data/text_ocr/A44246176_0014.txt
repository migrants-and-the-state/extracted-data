MY PARENTS AND FRANCISCO JR's PARENTS WERE LIKE FAMILY. TOGETHER THEY USED TO WORK IN MY COUNTRY. THEY PLANTED ALL TYPES OF EDIBLE GRAINES IN ORDER TO PROVIDE FOR THEIR FAMILIES, ALREADY THAT THIS WAS THE ONLY AVAILABLE WORK. FRANCISCO PAGOADA, JR. AND I WENT TO SCHOOL TOGETHER, WERE WE LEARNED THE SKILLS NECESSARY TO LEAD A MORE OR LESS NORMAL LIFESTYLE. THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY THAT THERE IS NO TANGIBLE, DOCUMENTED PROOF TO THE ABOVE STATED DUE TO THE FACT WE WERE RAISED IN A VERY SMALL, RURAL TOWN AND THEY LACKED THE IMPORTANCE OF MAINTAINING ADEQUATE RECORDS OF THIS TYPE OF INFORMATION. I DO HOWEVER TESTIFY THAT MR. FRANCISCO PAGOADA, FATHER AND AGRIPINA OVANDO, MOTHER, IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT THEY ARE NOT LEGALLY MARRIED HAVE ALWAYS BEEN GOOD PARENTS AND ABOVE ALL VERY CLOSE TO THEIR CHILDREN.
