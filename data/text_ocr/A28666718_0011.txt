This opinion is based on our analysis of country conditions and other relevant factors, plus an evaluation of the specific information provided in the application. We do not have independent information about this applicant. The strength of the application may be affected by your interview or hearing, or additional information subsequently presented by the applicant. Should you believe that any such additional information warrants further consideration, we will be happy to review the file again. Sincerely, may im Brisen for Edward H. Wilkinson, Director Office of Asylum Affairs Bureau of Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs
