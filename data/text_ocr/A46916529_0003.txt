You have filed an application for creation of a record of lawful admission for permanent residence under Section 249 of the Act, as amended. Section 249 provides in pertinent part: "A record of lawful admission for permanent residence may, in the discretion of the Attorney General and under such regulations as he may prescribe, be made in the case of any alien as of the date of the approval of his application or, if entry occurred prior to July 1, 1924, as of the date of such entry, if no such record is otherwise available and such alien shall satisfy the Attorney General that he is not inadmissible under Section 212(a) insofar as it relates to criminals, procurers and other immoral persons, subversives, violators of the narcotic laws or smugglers of aliens, and he establishes that he -- (a) entered the United States prior to January 1, 1972; (b) has had his residence in the United States continously since such entry " A review of the record reveals that the documents which you presented to this office in support of your application failed to establish that you have resided in the United States continuously since prior to January 1, 1972. Therefore, your application must be, and, hereby is, denied. In accordance with Title 8, Code of Federal Regulation, 274a.12 (c) (9) your authorization to accept employment was limited to the time necessary to decide the case. Inasmuch as the application for adjustment has been denied, authorization to accept employment is terminated, pursuant to Title 8, Code of Federal Regulation, 274a.14 (a) (1) . You will be further advised of procedures to effect your departure from the United States. Attachment to Form I-291 In Re: Francisca Hortencia Toledo File: A70 023 120
