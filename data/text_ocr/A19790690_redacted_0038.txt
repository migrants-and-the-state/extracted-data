Bakarich Immigration & Naturalization Service 333 U.S. Courthouse Portland, Oregon 97205 Dear Mr. Bakarich: I am writing this letter in support of my mother- in-law, Mrs. Nguyen Thi Nhat, and I am inclosing it with her application for an extension of stay here in the U.S. My wife just gave birth four weeks early to our child through a caesarean operation. Her mother has been of invaluable assistance to me in caring for my wife and our baby. She has especially been a great comfort and support to us. I hope that you will give her application a favor- able consideration and allow her to extend her stay with us. Thank you very much. Sincerely yours, James James McGeever P.S. I am inclosing her form I-94 and a check for $10.00 for the fee.
