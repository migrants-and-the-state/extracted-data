Screened by NARA, 9/18/2023 UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT or JUSTICE Iramigration and Naturalization Service File: A-7921505 - New York June 14, 1957 In re: LEE SUNG also known as LEE SANG PROCEEDINGS UNDER SECTION 243(h) OF THE IMMIGRATION AND NATIONALITY ACT IN BEHALF OF APPLICANT: Abraham Lebenkoff, Esq. 33 West 42nd Street New York 36, New York DEPORTABLE: Act of 1924 - No immigration visa APPLICATION: Stay of deportation DECUSSION: Applicant, a native and citizen of China, is under a final order of deportation stemming from his entry into the United States as a deserting crewman in December 1946. He requests that his deporta- tion to the China mainland be withheld as he fears physical persecution at the hands of the Communist authorities because of his opposing polit- ical beliefs. On October 31, 1956, pending receipt of official information which could assist in resolving the issues presented in this case, the applicant and other Chinose nationals in similar circumstances were granted a stay of deportation until July 1, 1957, It was believed that by that time the cooperating agencies of the United States government would have succeeded in obtaining the desired information; and this case, along with the others, could then receive further consideration. Such information not having been obtained as of this date, stay of deportation until January R, 1953, will be authorized. It should be made clear, however, that the conclusion reached in this case is not applicable, and no stay of deportation will be granted, to an individual Chinese national concerning whom there is positive affirmative proof that he would be welcomed by the authorities in Communist China upon his return there because of his express or implied sympathy for or cooperation with the present regime. Likewise, it should be clear that any stay of deportation granted by this order will not preclude the Service from attempting to deport or from deporting an alien to a place other than the mainland of China.
