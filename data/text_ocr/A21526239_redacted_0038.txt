Screened by NARA, 7/31/2023 by Air-mail to the Boston office. ? On May 10 76 my father again inquired in person at the Boston office and was informed that the files have not yet arrived at the Boston office. I fail to understand D why the Immigration office misinforms the public repeatedly and 2) why it takes more than 4 months for a simple job like transferring the files to another office. I was also told by Congressman Krebb's office ( 17th Congressional district, Calif.) that since I contacted your office is the first instance, I should contact you now, besides the matter do not in his jurisdiction any way as the papers are filed is the Boston office. I do not know what to do from here and who to turn to -hence this letter and request for help from you in expediting this never-ending process. Thank you in anticipation of your help and prompt attention, Sincerely Kamille Lathi mane.
