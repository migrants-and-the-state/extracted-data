Internal Medicine Chest Diseases Internal Medicine Gastroenterology January 6, 1978 INDEX CHECKED AT BFLO Department of Immigration on 1/12/78 by mm RE: Mr. Abdul Majid rr Mr. Abdul Majid has been under my professional care for the past many months. He suffers from osteonecrosis of medial femoral condyle, which condition, has caused severe, persistent and at times, incapacita- ting pain in his left knee. Medical therapy being unsuccessful, orthopedic consultation was sought. It is the recommendation of the orthopedic sonsultant that the patient undergo a hemiarthroplasty of the knee with prosthatic implant. I concur with his opinion and doubt that any other treatment would prove beneficial. I have recommended this course to the patient. This particular surgical procedure can be done only in the United States and is not done in Pakistan, the patient's home country. I, therefore, recommend that an extension of Mr. Majid's visa be granted on the grounds of absolute medical necessity. This extention should be for at least six (6) months.
