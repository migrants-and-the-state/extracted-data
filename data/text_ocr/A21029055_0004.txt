254 Parkview Drive Rochester, N.Y. 14625 June 15th 1975 United States Department of Justice Immigration & Naturalization Service U.S. Courthouse Buffalo, N.Y. 14202 Ref: Permit #032 02 52 Dear Sir: Pursuant to your letter of June 10th 1975 in which you have granted only one month extension, I must reiterate that this extension period is inadequate. I have come here for medical treatment and having trave- lled so long and having already spent a large sum of money, I am not about to go back without full treatment. I am suffering from a severe hearing loss and Dr. Fraser has asked me to stay until he is satisfied that I am cured. Please extend my visa until August 31st 1975. Very truly yours, ch.
