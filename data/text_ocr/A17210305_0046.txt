Form I-94 (c) T-2034877 issued to him at that time has been returned stamped by Canadian Immigration February 24, 1952, Douglas, B. C., thus verifying his departure from the United States." Through an oversight on the part of this Office you were not advised of the actual physical port of entry to the United States of this alien which was at Detroit, Michigan, on January 31, 1952. Will you kindly forward the appropriate bond forms relating to this man to Detroit in order that that office may institute bond cancel- lation proceedings should they find such action in order.
