by NARA, 9/18/2023 Memo to file FOIA (b)( (6) May 28, 1963 Called Atty Munoz to find location of subject. He thinks she is in New York trying to arrange entry into Canada. Says he only talked hersubject once and that when he was in with her on 4/16/63. Thinks Mex. Soc. Service knows wherealbouts. Mex. Soc. Service called by me and secretary states Mr. Varela not in, but she is sure subject is in New York trying to arrange entry into Canada to secure visa from Montreal. Called Daughter, Elisabeth Hyppolite at home phone RE 3-5161. Daughter very evasive but stated her mother had departed from LOS Int. Airport on TWA on 4/17/63 and was on way to Haiti. States hasn't heard from mother yet. When asked about New York, became evasive and said her mother went to Haiti and that we could come out to the house and look if we wished. Nothing further, in the way of leads. Believe Mex. Soc. Service has knowledge of whereabouts of subject. Also believe Mrs. Hyppolite can give more info. Jaynes.
