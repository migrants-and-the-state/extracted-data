Included on my case was the following relative: NAME: FOIA (b)(6) FILE NUMBER: FOIA (b)(6) RELATIONSHIP TO ME: DAUGHTER IN-LAW This relative has now been found inadmissable as a result of testing postitive for the HIV virus. Both my relative and I am aware of the nature of this disease and after discussing the situation with my relative, I wish to pursue U.S. resettlement without including him or her on my case. I have been advised that before being allowed to enter the United States, my relative will require a waiver from INS. I have been advised further that such waivers are often not approved and therefore my relative will not be able to join me in the near future and quite possibly may not be able to join me at all FOIA (b)(6) INS Officer and Title for Somale Translator Language
