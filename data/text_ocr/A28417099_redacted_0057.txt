I was called by Mr. Fonseca's attorney, Alsy Lomangino. She wanted to know whether I would agree to Judge Horn entering an order granting the alien one year's voluntary departure. My normal policy is not to agree to any period of voluntary departure longer than six months. However, based upon this subject's advanced age and physical condition, I am willing to make an exception to that policy in this unique case. Therefore, you are authorized to agree to a period of one year's voluntary departure in this case. Form G-2 (Rev. 1-2-80
