Screened by NARA, 9/18/2023 HASKELL R. BARST COUNSELOR AT LAW SIXTY BROAD STREET NEW YORK HANOVER 2-0565 October 10, 1956 1011 U. S. Department of Justice Immigration & Naturalization Service 70 Columbus Avenue New York 23, New York OCT1 2 1956 Attention: Parole Section NATURATIONA Re: Mar Doo File No. A10 294 862 Gentlemen: Reference is made to your file relative to the above named and particularly to your letter, Form 3-2677, dated October 3, 1956, in which you state that the above named has been granted until November 3, 1956 to arrange for his departure from the United States. You have requested him to appear at your office on October 17, 1956 with evidence of transportation. Upon information which I have received, it would appear that it will not be possible for the above named to effect his departure from the United States on or before November 3, 1956. He cannot ar- range for paid transportation outside the United States for the reason that there is no country which would accept him. He has had difficulties in finding a berth on a vessel and it would appear that he will not be successful in obtaining such employment in the immediate future. In the event that an order of deportation is entered against him, I would appreciate your so informing me so that there may be filed in his behalf an application for a stay of deportation pursuant to the provisions of Section 243h of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Very truly yours HASKELL R. BARST HRB:ea
