FOIA (b)(6) June 5, 1956. A10 534 184 Mr. Vence Segulia Tornille, Texas Dear Sir: This office has under investigation the cases of two aliens in whose files there appears what is alleged to be your signature. Inasmuch as the signatures do not appear similar it is believed that one or both pro- bably are forgeries. It is believed that Investigator Parks talked to you informally in regard to this matter some time ago but did not have the files available to show you. It is requested that you call at this office at Room 315 of the U. S. Court House at your earliest convenience and ask to see Mr. Parks in regard to this matter. Very truly yours, For the District Director William C. Dunn, Acting Chief Investigations Branch CEP:LGB
