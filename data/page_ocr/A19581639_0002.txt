Screened by NARA, 7/13/2023 3023 Heirloom Way Sacramento, Ca. 95826 April 3, 1980 Mr. Clegg, Deportation Branch, 630 Sansome Street, San Francisco, Ca. 94111 Dear Sir, This is with reference to our request for my grand-mother Mrs. Dhankunvar Mahanlal Gatha's (file number A 24 216 295) extended stay with us in the U.S.A. I understand that your office has advised Congressman Matsui that my grandmother will not be granted permanent residency in the United States but that her departure will not be enforced by your office. I have in my previous application explained the condition of her health. As of now, her health has not improved at all since then. She requires constant care and to be with her family here. Since there is nobody in India to take care of her, I request once again to give an extension of her voluntary departure date. Her doctor's certificate is attached herewith. Hoping for an early reply, Yours sincerely, Mrussemitharwale
