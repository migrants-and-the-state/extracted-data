This finding does not appear to be clinically significant. The lungs are otherwise entirely clear. The hilar shadows outline normally. The leaves of the diaphragm are in normal position. The heart is normal in size and shape; the bony thorax is intact. SUMMARY: Study of the chest is essentially negative. Cordially yours, Venton Victor Kremens, M.D. VK/1f
