Screened by NARA, 7/13/2023 March 9, 1984 To Whom It May Concern: By this mean I want to state that I've known Mrs. Elida Bolanos for several years . She was an active member of Somoza's Government. Mrs. Bolanos occupied several positions while Somoza governed the country and she also had a close relation- ship with Somoza's family. For all the reasons listed above, Mrs. Bolanos had to live Nicaragua when Somoza's government was defeated because she feared that her freedom was in danger.
