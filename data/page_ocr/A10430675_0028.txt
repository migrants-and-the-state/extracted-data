June 21, 1955 TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN: I have known Mr. Maoling Liu since 1947. Since 1948 we have both been employed on the staff of the Electrical Engineering Department of the University of Minnesota, and for the last several years have had adjoining offices. I feel that I know him as well as I know anyone on the staff. I can give you the highest recommendations for Mr. Liu. He is a very able and friendly person, liked by both colleagues and students. Mr. Liu is an active member of one of the local Congregational churches. Of all the students and staff members from foreign countries that I have known, there is no one I would rather see become a permanent resident of this country. I feel that he will make a real contribution to the good of our country. Yours very truly, Aither CSannett Arthur C.
