Screened by NARA, 4/18/2023 VILLAGE HEALTH CARE 122 VILLAGE CENTER IRVING TEXAS 75061 972 445-2040 FAX 972 438-2829 August 1,2006 Re: Yarey Doyou To Whom It May Concern: Yarey Doyou is a 100 year old female who has been seen and treated at this office since 1998 for multiple medical problems. This patient has a history of congestive heart failure, hypertensive cardio vascular disease, puerperal edema and degenerative joint disease of lumbar spine. Because of her age with her heart problems I feel she is incapable of remembering or learning English, Civics and US History. She cannot speak any English and is confined to a wheelchair due to her back and legs. If you have any questions please call this office. Thank You Alan B. Mickish, M.D.
