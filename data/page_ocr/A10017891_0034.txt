Screened by NARA, 9/6/2023 I do not know too much about citizenship, my husband always told me that he used the name Oi in the United States. I realize now that I entered the United Skaes States illegally on February 13, 1955 when I was admitted as a spouse of a United States citiizen. I know now that my husband is not a citizen of the United States. I have never been arrested. I have never been a member of the Communist Party or any of its affiliates or any other organizations. I have reported my address in the month of January since I have resided in this country. By my marriage we have the following children: 1. WONG KWONG SANG, son, born February 1930 March 3, 1930, at Got Mee Leong Village, SND, China, now living at 269 Tai Nam St., Kowloon, Hong Kong, 4th floor. He is married. 2. WONG MEI LING aka RITA, daughter, born February 22, 1939 at Gow Mee Leong Village, SND, China, now living at 128 Hemenway St., Boston, Mass. She is married. - 2 -
