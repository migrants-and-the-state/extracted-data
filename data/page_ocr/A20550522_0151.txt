Screened by NARA, 7/18/2023 -2- The total amount invested which we can document at this time is thus $7,784.20. In addition to this, numerous other pieces of equipment were purchased for which we have been unable to obtain a receipt as yet. In addition to the purchases, a sum of money was required as working capital to carry the busi- ness through its first few weeks of operation. This working capital totalled at least $2,000.00. We hope that this will satisfy your requirements and that you will process the case as soon as possible. Thank you for your cooperation.
