Screened by NARA, 7/13/2023 March 9, 1984 To Whom It May Concern: This is to testify that I've known Mrs. Elida Bolanos for several years. Mrs Bolanos was an active member within General Somoza Government and was the founder of The Feminine Party for Mr. Somoza Bayle's politic campaign. She occupied a position in the Department of Agri- culture and also, she had a close relationship with Somoza's family until General Somoza was defeated. For all of the above reasons Mrs. Bolanos can not go back to Nicaragua since this may endanger her freedom in that country. Sincerely Colonel Enrique Garcia G.
