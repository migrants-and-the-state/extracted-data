The heart is normal in size. Increased markings are noted bilaterally especially at the right base. It is uncertain if they are real or artifactual in nature secondary to a degree of inspiration. The aorta is tortuous. Degenerative changes of the thoracic spine are noted. No effusions are noted. IMPRESSION LESS THAN OPTIMAL DEGREE OF INSPIRATION. QUESTIONABLE INCREASED MARKINGS BILATERALLY. A FOLLOW-UP FILM IS RECOMMENDED WITH DEEP INSPIRATION TO EXCLUDE A RIGHT BASALAR INFILTRATE. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING US TO EVALUATE THIS PATIENT. MD Robert J. Hyman, M.D. /CW 02/22/95 10:24:54
