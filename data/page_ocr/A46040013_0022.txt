An applicant's difficulty in fulfiling the requirements is not sufficient to support a waiver. In addition, illiteracy in the applicant's native language is not sufficient, by itself, to support a finding of inability to learn and/or demonstrate knowledge. 3. Based on your examination of the applicant, provide detailed information on the connection between the impairment(s) and the applicant's inability to learn and/or demonstrate knowledge of English and/or U.S. history and civics (see Instructions for examples).
