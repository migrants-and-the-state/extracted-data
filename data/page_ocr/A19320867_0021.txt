7024 Hedgewood Dr. Rancho Palos Verdes, CA 90275 Tel.: 310/541-9476 April 6, 1998 U.S. Department of Justice Immigration and Naturalization Service Citizenship U.S.A. Re: Chi Su Wu, A 19320867 S.S.# 388-70-9424 Dear Examiner: My mom, Mrs. Chi Su Wu, is applying to become a citizen of the U.S. She emigrated here in 1991 to join the three of her four children after the death of her husband. She has tried very diligently to learn English and American history and government since she arrived here. But due to her age (84) and memory impairment (please see attached statement by Dr. Keh-Ming Lin), her progress has been very frustrating. However, as I worked with her almost daily on her learning the History and Government of the U.S.A., I noticed that she is able to retain more knowledge in Chinese than in English. If she may not be exempted entirely from the Citizenship Examination, I would like to respectfully request that she be examined in Chinese. I will be her interpreter. We are greatly appreciative to you for your consideration. Sincerely, Joye sole Joyce Wu Yeh, Chi Su L. Wu's daughter P.S. Please note that Mrs. Wu first became a permanent resident of the United States in 1974 as indicated on the attached copy of an Application for Issuance or Extension of Permit to Reenter the United States. She maintained her P.R. status until 1986 when my father became too ill to stay in the U.S.. My mom left this country and accompanied him to Taiwan for treatment because he was more familiar with the medical service and the language there. My father never recovered and my mom had to stay to take care of him until his death in 1991. As the result of this prolonged stay out of the U.S., Mrs. Wu lost her P.R. status. If it had not been my father's illness, my mom would have been a permanent resident for 24 years, eligible for taking the examination in Chinese. M
