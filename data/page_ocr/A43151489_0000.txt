At that time, she had moved to her village (SONTA, MUZAFFARNAGAR, U.P. ), gotten sick, and transferred to Bhatinida, Punjab. so she could not be taken for VISA interview and The required medical examination There after, the validity of her Indian Passport expired The application for a new passport is pending with the Regional Passport office, IzatNagan U.P., India, for the past several months. In March-April, 1991, I went to India expecting that the visa interview could be arranged at this time But The Indian passport could not be obtained during this period We expect that the Indian passport would be issued at the latest by the end of 1991 and have made arrangements for her to be brought to New Delhi for medical examination and visa and thereafter to the U.S. Therefore, we have to request you to kndly reopen her case NO. 88128141 and arrange a date for her visa interview in January - February, 1992. I may submit that she has been in India for about four years now (19876 present) since she left the U.S. She
