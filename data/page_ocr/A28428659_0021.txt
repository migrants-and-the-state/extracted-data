Ss. Joachim & Anne Church 218-26 105TH AVENUE QUEENS VILLAGE, N. Y. 11429 March 4, 1987 Immigration and Naturalization Service 26 Federal Plaza New York, New York 10278 Re: Rev. Edgard Delouis Dear Sir/Madam: This letter is to support the application of Rev. Edgar Delouis for lawful permanent residence. The population of this area is mainly Haitian. Therefore, Rev. Delouis C services become vital because of his knowledge of the Haitian population's customs and language. The position as a Parochial Vicar of this Parish requires a duly ordained priest in good standing with his Diocese and able to assist me with the Haitian population living in this area. We have great need for Rev. Edgar Delouis services since we need a priest who speaks French and Haitian Creole and because of his background in language and Haitian culture. SS. Joachim & Anne Church wishes to employ him starting immediately. Sincerely Yours in Christ, Rev. garvey g. meade Rev. Garvey Go Meade, Pastor
