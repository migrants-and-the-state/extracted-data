Screened by NARA, 7/21/2023 BASED ON THE FOREGOING, THIS CASE IS. HEREBY: APPROVED DENIED SUMMARY OF REASONS FOR DENIAL: (CHECK APPLICABLE REASONS AND COMPLETE DENIAL WORKSHEET) APPLICANT DID NOT ESTABLISH HIS OWN INCLUSION IN AND IDENTIFICATION WITH ONE OF THE DESIGNATED CATEGORIES.

THE EVENTS, ACTION (s) AND SURROUNDING CIRCUMSTANCES SET FORTH BY THE APPLICANT IN HIS APPLICATION AND DEVELOPED DURING THE INTERVIEW DID NOT SUPPORT HIS ASSERTION OF A WELL-FOUNDED (i.e. "REASONABLE") FEAR OF PERSECUTION ON ACCOUNT OF RACE, RELIGION, NATIONALITY, MEMBERSHIP IN A' PARTICULAR SOCIAL GROUP, OR POLITICAL OPINION. THE APPLICANT'S ACCOUNT OF EVENTS, ACTIONS, PROCEDURES, AND POLICIES WHICH HE ASSERTED INVOLVED PERSECUTION OR A CREDIBLE CONCERN THEREOF WAS NOT CONSISTENT WITH WHAT IS KNOWN AND ACCEPTED AS ACTUAL CONDITIONS, POLICIES OR PRACTICES IN HIS COUNTRY OF ORIGIN. DESPITE THE CONCERN ABOUT PERSECUTION OR A WELL-FOUNDED FEAR OF PERSECUTION THE APPLICANT HAS ASSERTED, CONDITIONS IN HIS COUNTRY OF ORIGIN HAVE CHANGED TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT HE NO LONGER HAD A CREDIBLE CONCERN OF PRESENT PERSECUTION WHICH WOULD HAVE RENDERED HIM UNABLE TO RETURN TO OR REMAIN IN HIS COUNTRY OF ORIGIN. APPLICANT IS INADMISSABLE TO THE UNITED STATES UNDER SECTION 212 (a) ( ) OF THE INA, AS AMENDED, AND THIS EXCLUDABILITY HAS NOT BEEN WAIVED. EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT THE APPLICANT WAS FIRMLY RESETTLED IN AND THEREFORE INELIGIBLE FOR RESETTLEMENT. TO THE UNITED STATES. EVIDENCE EXISTED THAT APPLICANT ORDERED, INCITED; ASSISTED, OR OTHERWISE PARTICIPATED IN THE PERSECUTION OF ANOTHER PERSON ON ACCOUNT OF RACE, RELIGION, NATIONALITY, MEMBERSHIP IN A PARTICULAR SOCIAL GROUP, OR POLITICAL OPINION.
