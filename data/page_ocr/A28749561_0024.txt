Screened by NARA, 4/27/2023 Robert J Moon 801 Norumbega Dr. Monrovia, Caifornia 91016 To whom it may concern: Mr. Efren Magana was an Independent Gardener Contractor for me continuously from 1975 to 1983. His work consisted of maintaining a 3 acre grove for me. He also, worked for other parties in this area at the same time. Mr. Mangana worked for several people that I knew for some years before and after he contracted with me. His work was satisfactory; but, I no longer could afford to maintain the grove the way that I wanted. Therefore, to the best of my knowledge, he has been in this country continuously since the early 1970's and has worked for many different parties.
