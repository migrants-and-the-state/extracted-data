Somerset Blvd. Paramount, CA 90723 Re: Application for Permanent Residence Applicant: PO, Kam Ying Petitioner: LAI, Wing On (USC) Our File no. 75 Dear Thomas: As a follow-up to our telephone conversation last night concerning the bove-referenced application, enclosed herewith please find the entire application package. I personally submitted the same package to the INS office two weeks ago and they rejected the application on the basis that (1) applicant's pictures were of wrong image size and (2) I did not provide them with copy of certain documents, such as Form I-797, applicant's passport and I-94, and petitioner's birth certificate and certificate of citizenship. You will find from the enclosed package new pictures taken last week and a copy of all the required documents. If there is any shortage of required documents, please let me know at your earliest opportunity. Thanks for your help! Please send us a bill upon the completion of the filing. Sincerely, Josephily Joseph Wu, Ph.D. /jw Encls.
