U.S. Department of Justice Immigration and Naturalization Service APR 2 6 1988 District Director 300 North Los Angeles Street Las Angeles, CA. 90012 LOS DIEXM 249 File: A 28793184 Andrea Montedeoca 3100 Surra Street Los Angeles, la 90031 Dear Ms. pluntedesca : This office has received your application for creation of a record of lawful admission, filed under Section 249 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Eligibility for benefits under that section 1 S based upon your continuous residence in the United States since January 1, 1972. Upon review of your application, it has been determined that you do not appear to be prima facie eligible for the benefits of "registry. The Legalization or "Amnesty" Program is similar in nature to "Registry," but the period of residence which must be established begins January 1, 1982. There are some differences in other requirements, but many applicants for "Registry" are also eligible for Legalization. On May 4, 1988, the Legalization Program expires. The "Registry" Program, however, will continue indefinitely. Since the Legalization Program expires soon, and because you do not appear eligible for registry, this office recommends that you consider immediately filing an application for Legalization. Filing both applications in no way jeopardizes your eligibility for either program. We will continue to process your application for "Registry," and you will be notified of its outcome. To facilitate the application process for Legalization, you are permitted to submit the application form (I-687) alone. You will be permitted to submit supporting documents at the time of your interview, which will be scheduled at least 60 days after the date of filing.
