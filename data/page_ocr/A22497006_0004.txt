Screened by NARA, 6/8/2023 U.S. Department of Justice Information About the Form N-648 Immigration and Naturalization Service Medical Certification For Disability Exceptions For a permanent resident to take the oath of allegiance and become a naturalized citizen, he or she must demonstrate knowledge of English and U.S. history and government. The Immigration and Nationality Act authorizes an exception to this requirement for individuals who are unable to learn or demonstrate knowledge of English or U.S. history and government because of a physical or developmental disability or mental impairment. This exception is known as a "disability exception." This form is intended to provide information about the disability exception to applicants for naturalization and to answer the most frequently asked questions relating to disability exceptions. This form must be read together with the instructions on the Form N-648, Medical Certification for Disability Exceptions, and should be given to the applicant's doctor if the applicant believes that he or she might be eligible for the disability exception. Who Qualifies for a Disability Exception? An applicant for naturalization can qualify for a disability exception by demonstrating that he or she suffers from a medically determinable disability or impairment or combination of impairments that result(s) in functioning so impaired that it prevents him or her from learning or demonstrating knowledge of English and/or U.S. history and government. The authorized medical profession must therefore provide: 1) a full and complete description of the applicant's diagnosis; 2) a thorough explanation of how the condition diagnosed has impaired the functioning of the applicant so severely that the applicant is unable to learn or demonstrate knowledge of English and/or U.S. history and government; and 3) his or her conclusion about whether or not the applicant is able to learn or demonstrate knowledge of English and/or U.S. history and government. The impairment must not be temporary (i.e., less than 12 months). ! NOTE: An applicant will not qualify for a disability exception if the sole basis for the request is that he or she cannot learn or demonstrate knowledge of English and/or U.S. history and government because of old age, or if the impairment is the sole result of the illegal use of drugs. How Does One Apply for a Disability Exception? An applicant for naturalization may apply for a disability exception by submitting a Form N-648, Medical Certification for Disability Exceptions, along with the N-400, Application for Naturalization. The Form N-648 should be submitted with the N-400 within six months of when it was completed and signed by the authorized medical professional. The Form N-648 may be presented to the INS officer conducting the naturalization interview in limited circumstances, such as if the applicant developed a disability after submitting the N-400 application. In such cases, the N-648 must have been completed within six months of the interview date and applicants requesting a disability exception should present the N-648 to the INS officer at the beginning of the interview. Applicants will be given two opportunities to present a sufficient Form N-648 to INS and to pass the English and U.S. history and government (civics) tests. Which Medical Professionals Are Authorized to Complete the Form? Medical and osteopathic doctors and clinical psychologists who are licensed to practice in the United States are authorized to complete the form N-648. N-648A (3-30-99)
