Screened by NARA, 7/13/2023 January 14, 1983 A19 581 639 (I-51) Mr. Ishrat Aziz Consul General of India 540 Arguello Blvd. San Francisco, CA 94118 Dear Mr. Aziz: This service is attempting to determine if deportation proceedings should be instituted in a case involving an 85 year old female citizen of India. Although she currently resides in the United States with family members, the circumstances are such that she is ineligible to obtain permanent residence here. She is in poor health, suffering from spondylitis, osteoporosis, glaucoma and aphakia and requires continuous care. The cost of her medical care is being borne by public funds. She has no close relatives in India and no means of support apart from her family in the United States. Prior to making a determination in this case we are requesting that you advise this office if there are facilities in India which will provide care for this individual. Thank you for your assistance in this matter. Sincerely David N. Ilchert District Director
